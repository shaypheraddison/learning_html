        <h2>A New Language !</h2>
        <p>
            This is my <em>makeshift</em> HTML page to learn the language.
            HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. HTML is <strong>NOT</strong> a programming language,
            instead it is a markup language. It basically is used to tell the browswer how to display content for the end user.
        </p>
        <p>
            Can you tell I am learning how to do this? Here is a good link to learn alongside with me about HTML -

        <h2>Vin Scully's Final Call</h2>
        <time>08.02.2022</time>
        <p><u>The best baseball call from the GOAT of broadcasters.</u></p>
        <blockquote cite="https://www.latimes.com/sports/story/2022-08-02/here-are-some-of-vin-scullys-most-memorable-calls-and-quotes#:~:text=His%20final%20words%20as%20a%20Dodgers%20broadcaster%3A&text=May%20God%20give%20you%2C%20for,an%20answer%20for%20each%20prayer">
            <p>
                “You know, friends, so many people have wished me congratulations on a 67-year career in baseball, and they've wished me a wonderful retirement with my family, and now, all I can do is tell you what I wish for you. 
                May God give you, for every storm, a rainbow; for every tear, a smile; for every care, a promise; and a blessing in each trial. 
                For every problem life seems, a faithful friend to share; for every sigh, a sweet song, and an answer for each prayer. 
                You and I have been friends for a long time, but I know, in my heart, I've always needed you more than you've ever needed me, and I'll miss our time together more than I can say. 
                But, you know what, there will be a new day, and, eventually, a new year, and when the upcoming winter gives way to spring, ooh, rest assured, once again, it will be time for Dodger baseball. 
                So, this is Vin Scully wishing you a pleasant good aftrnoon, wherever you may be.”
