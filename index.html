<h1>Makeshift HTML Page</h1> 

<h3>A New Language !</h3>
<p>
    This is my <i>testing</i> <u>HTML</u> page to <b>learn</b> the language.
HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. HTML is <strong>NOT</strong> a programming language,
instead it is a markup language. It basically is used to tell the browswer how to display content for the end user.
</p>
<p>Can you tell I am learning how to do this? Here is a good link to learn alongside with me about HTML -

<h2>Vin Scully's Final Call</h2>
<p>The best baseball call from the GOAT of broadcasters.</p>
<blockquote cite="https://www.latimes.com/sports/story/2022-08-02/here-are-some-of-vin-scullys-most-memorable-calls-and-quotes#:~:text=His%20final%20words%20as%20a%20Dodgers%20broadcaster%3A&text=May%20God%20give%20you%2C%20for,an%20answer%20for%20each%20prayer">
    “You know, friends, so many people have wished me congratulations on a 67-year career in baseball, and they've wished me a wonderful retirement with my family, and now, all I can do is tell you what I wish for you. 
    May God give you, for every storm, a rainbow; for every tear, a smile; for every care, a promise; and a blessing in each trial. 
    For every problem life seems, a faithful friend to share; for every sigh, a sweet song, and an answer for each prayer. 
    You and I have been friends for a long time, but I know, in my heart, I've always needed you more than you've ever needed me, and I'll miss our time together more than I can say. 
    But, you know what, there will be a new day, and, eventually, a new year, and when the upcoming winter gives way to spring, ooh, rest assured, once again, it will be time for Dodger baseball. 
    So, this is Vin Scully wishing you a pleasant good afternoon, wherever you may be.”
